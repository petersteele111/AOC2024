# AOC2024

AOC2024 is a C# project designed to solve problems from the Advent of Code 2024. The project is organized by days and parts, with each part containing a specific solution to a problem.

## Project Structure

- `Program.cs`: The main entry point of the application.
- `Day1/Part1.cs`: Solution for Day 1, Part 1.
- `Day1/Part2.cs`: Solution for Day 1, Part 2.
- `Day1/input.txt`: Input file for Day 1 problems.
- `Day2/Part1.cs`: Solution for Day 2, Part 1.

This structure will be repeated for each day of the Advent of Code 2024.
